# Overview

This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on predicting the severity of vehicle crashes. The project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes such as vehicle make, type, year, driver age, gender, and environmental conditions to classify crashes into three categories: severe, moderate, and minor. By leveraging predictive modeling techniques, the aim is to develop a robust model that can assist in assessing crash severity and implementing targeted safety measures.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises detailed information about vehicle crashes, including vehicle attributes, driver details, crash severity, and environmental conditions. With features such as vehicle make, type, and driver demographics, the dataset provides valuable insights into factors influencing crash severity.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build an accurate classification model capable of predicting the severity of vehicle crashes. By analyzing the relationships between various attributes and crash outcomes, the model aims to aid authorities, emergency responders, and policymakers in better understanding crash dynamics and implementing effective safety interventions.

# Methodology
The project follows a systematic methodology encompassing data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are employed to train and optimize the predictive model.
